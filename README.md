### Architecture:
Project is developed in kotlin programming  language with Mvvm Architecture and jetpack components.

### Libraries Used

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - A suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the code they care about.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Doing manual dependency injection requires you to construct every class and its dependencies by hand, and to use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Data Binding,ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)-The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
- [Material Design support libraries](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started) - Modern UI designing library for modern apps.
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/flow) Flow API in Kotlin is a better way to handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.
